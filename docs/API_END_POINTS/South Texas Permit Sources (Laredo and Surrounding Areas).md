**South Texas Permit Sources (Laredo and Surrounding Areas)** 

South Texas cities publish fewer open datasets, but the available resources can still provide early signals of construction activity. This document outlines the primary sources for Laredo and nearby jurisdictions. 

**Laredo** 

•    
**CKAN Open Data – Building Permits** – The Open Laredo portal hosts a Building Permits 1   
dataset with permit numbers, valuations, fees and addresses . Separate resources include a  **Permits Issued Report XLSX** and a **Building Permits CSV**. These files capture permit issue dates, project valuations and contractor names and can be downloaded as spreadsheets for parsing. •    
**Inspections data** – The same dataset bundle includes a **Building Inspections CSV** which records inspection outcomes. Monitoring early inspections (e.g., foundation or framing) can hint at project progression. 

**Regional considerations** 

•    
**Data frequency** – Unlike the larger metros, South Texas cities often update permit data monthly or 

quarterly. Be prepared for lower data velocity. 

•    
**Local newspapers and city council agendas** – In regions with limited open data, local news outlets 

and council minutes often contain notices of significant development projects (e.g., new warehouses, medical facilities). Scraping these sources can yield leads not available elsewhere.
