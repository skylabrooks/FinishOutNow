## 🎯 What You're Selling

### **In One Sentence:**] 
> "Early BookS helps contractors find and claim high-value commercial permits BEFORE their competitors do."

### **The 30-Second Elevator Pitch:**

*"Hi [Name], I'm with Early BookS. We help [Security/Signage/IT] contractors in Dallas-Fort Worth find commercial permits the day they're filed—often days or weeks before brokers even know about them. Our AI scores each permit by how likely it is to need your services, and because we have a 'first-come, first-served' claiming system, your team can lock in leads fast. Are you currently looking at ways to find more commercial leads?"*

---

## 👥 Who You're Selling To

### **The Decision Makers (Who to Call):**
- 🎯 **Owner** (best) - Makes buying decisions
- 🎯 **VP of Sales** (very good) - Controls lead strategy
- 🎯 **Project Manager** (okay) - Influences owner, gets frustrated with lead quality
- ❌ **Admin/Office Manager** - Usually not decision-makers

### **The Perfect Customer:**
- ✅ 5-50 person company
- ✅ In security, signage, IT, or general construction
- ✅ Currently finding leads manually or through brokers
- ✅ Frustrated with slow lead flow or high costs
- ✅ Has teams that can move fast on new leads

### **NOT Your Customer (Skip These):**
- ❌ Solo contractor with no team
- ❌ National chain (they have their own systems)
- ❌ Company only doing residential work
- ❌ Company that's completely happy with current lead source

---

## 🗣️ The Sales Pitch

### **Step 1: The Hook (Grab Attention)**
*"Most contractors find leads the same way—checking city websites or waiting for broker calls. But while they're doing that, your competitors are already planning their bids."*

**Why it works:** Creates urgency. Makes them realize they might be losing.

---

### **Step 2: The Pain (Identify the Problem)**
Ask these questions:
1. **"How many NEW commercial leads is your team finding per week?"**
2. **"How long does it take to research each lead?"**
3. **"Are you ever surprised that a competitor already got to a lead you wanted?"**

**Listen for YES to any of these** → They're a perfect prospect.

---

### **Step 3: The Solution (Show the Product)**
*"Here's what Early BookS does: Every day, we pull new commercial permits from Dallas, Fort Worth, Plano, Arlington, and Irving. Our AI instantly scores each one for YOUR trade. It tells you:*
- *Is this a real commercial opportunity? (confidence %)*
- *What trade work is likely needed?*
- *How much is the project worth?*
- *Is the company legitimate? (verified against Texas records)*

*Then here's the cool part—first contractor to claim the lead gets the full contact info. This means you can reach out while the permit is still hot."*

---

### **Step 4: The Numbers (Show ROI)**
*"Here's the math: Dallas-Fort Worth has about 1,000+ new commercial permits every month. Let's say 40% are relevant to your trade. That's 400 leads per month available. If you claim just 10-20 per week and turn 2-3 into jobs at $50K-$100K each? That's $100K-$300K in new revenue monthly, and you're paying less than $[price] for the leads."*

**Math They Can Picture:**
- 400 permits/month in DFW ÷ 30 days = **13-14 new leads per day**
- Claim 3-5/day = **15-25/week**
- Convert 1-2 = **New revenue**

---

### **Step 5: The Proof (Build Trust)**
*"We verify every company against Texas Comptroller records. No ghost companies. No bad leads. Plus, because it's 'first-come, first-served,' you know nobody else has reached that person yet. You're first."*

---

### **Step 6: The Close**
*"I can get you set up in 5 minutes. You'd have access to this week's permits by tomorrow morning. Why don't we start with a 2-week trial? No credit card required. You can literally try it for free and decide if it's worth keeping."*

## 💬 Handling Objections

### **Objection #1: "How accurate is this AI?"**

**What They're Really Asking:** Can I trust this or will I waste time on bad leads?

**Your Answer:**
*"Great question. Our AI is 75-90% accurate on trade matches. But here's the key—we verify the company against Texas Comptroller data. So if it says 'Verified Entity,' you know the company actually exists and is actively doing business. Plus, you get a free 2-week trial. Try 50-100 leads. If the quality isn't there, you stop. No risk."*

**If They Say:** "That doesn't sound good enough"
**Counter:** *"Most brokers don't verify at all. You're actually getting better intel. But you're right—that's why we do the free trial. See for yourself."*

---

### **Objection #2: "We already have a broker / lead source"**

**What They're Really Asking:** Why would I switch or pay for both?

**Your Answer:**
*"Actually, most of our customers use brokers AND us. Here's why: Brokers react after the fact. We're proactive—you see permits the DAY they're filed, sometimes days before brokers' lists go out. So you reach out first. Plus, you're not paying per-lead fees—it's one flat monthly rate. Use us to find more leads, keep your broker relationship for big deals. Make sense?"*

**If They Ask:** "How much does it cost?"
**Answer:** *"[Price]. Unlimited leads in 5 cities. No per-lead fees, no surprises. We can try it for 2 weeks free first."*

---

### **Objection #3: "We don't have time to check a new system every day"**

**What They're Really Asking:** Will this create more work for my team?

**Your Answer:**
*"Actually, it saves time. Here's what our customers tell us: Instead of spending 2 hours researching leads on city websites, they spend 20 minutes on Early BookS. The AI already did the research. They just need to decide 'Do I want this lead or not?' and claim it. That's it."*

**If They Say:** "But we'd have to train our team"
**Counter:** *"5-minute setup. Seriously. I'll do it on a Zoom call or phone. Your team can start using it immediately. We also have 24/7 chat support if they get stuck."*

---

### **Objection #4: "This sounds too good to be true"**

**What They're Really Asking:** Is there a catch?

**Your Answer:**
*"The only 'catch' is that you have to actually reach out to the leads. Early BookS finds them, verifies them, and scores them. But closing is up to you. That said, because you're reaching out first, your odds are way better than if you waited weeks. Plus, 2-week trial. If it's not working, you know after 2 weeks. No commitment."*

---

### **Objection #5: "Your competitor does the same thing"**

**What They're Really Asking:** Why you over them?

**Your Answer:**
*"Couple reasons: First, [state specific advantage: faster updates / better AI / local focus / better interface]. Second, we have the claiming system—first contractor to claim gets it. That's unique. Third, we focus on [Security/Signage/IT] contractors specifically, not everyone. We're built for your business. Want to try us head-to-head? 2-week trial and you'll see."*

---

## 🎬 Closing Techniques

### **Technique #1: The Trial Close (BEST FOR NOVICES)**
*"Let's just get you started with a 2-week trial. No credit card, no commitment. You try it, see if the leads are good, and then we can talk about moving forward. Sound fair?"*

**Why it works:** Low pressure. They can't say no to "free."

---

### **Technique #2: The Alternative Close**
*"So, do you want to start with our [Plan A] or would [Plan B] work better for your team?"*

**Why it works:** Both options move them forward. They're just picking which one.

---

### **Technique #3: The Time Close**
*"I can get you set up in 5 minutes. Should we do it right now on this call, or do you want to try it tonight and I'll follow up tomorrow?"*

**Why it works:** Gives them control but either way you're getting them set up.

---

### **Technique #4: The Competitor Close**
*"Your competitors are probably already using something like this. Is that something you want to stay ahead of, or are you good where you're at?"*

**Why it works:** FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Works on competitive business owners.

---

### **Technique #5: The Question Close**
*"If I could guarantee you'd have 3-5 new qualified leads per week for the next month, would that be worth trying for 2 weeks?"*

**Why it works:** They answer yes to the question before they realize they just agreed.

## 💰 Pricing & Plans

### **IMPORTANT: Ask Your Manager for Current Pricing**
Sales plans and pricing change. **DO NOT make up numbers.** Always say:

*"Let me get you exact current pricing. I want to make sure you're seeing our best offer."*

Then ask your manager or check the internal pricing guide.

---

### **General Tier Structure (Example - Confirm with Manager):**

| Plan | Monthly | Leads/Month | Best For |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| **Starter** | $[X] | Unlimited | Small teams (3-5 people) |
| **Professional** | $[X] | Unlimited | Growing teams (10-20 people) |
| **Enterprise** | $[X] | Unlimited | Large teams (20+ people) |

---

### **What to Say When They Ask Price:**

**If they seem hesitant:**
*"I know it's an investment. But think about this: If you close just ONE deal from Early BookS this year, it pays for itself 10x over. Most of our customers close 3-5 deals per year from these leads. So really, it's not a cost—it's an investment in your pipeline."*

**If they want a discount:**
*"Great question. Let me see what I can do. Can you commit to 3 months? I might be able to get you a [X% off] offer."*
