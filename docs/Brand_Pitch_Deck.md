# Slide 1 — Title
# **E BookGov**
### "We Handle Everything. You Handle… Something, Probably."

A fully integrated TI contractor sales engine for the Dallas–Fort Worth market.

Our technology identifies high-value commercial opportunities, makes the outreach, and even schedules your meetings—because you have important things to do. Or unimportant things. We’re not here to judge.

# Slide 2 — The Problem (Presented Very Seriously)
Contractors face enormous challenges, including:
- Following up with leads they asked for  
- Calling phone numbers that ring  
- Remembering appointments more than 24 hours in advance  
- Responding to inbound interest without emotional distress  
- Having a sales process  

These systemic industry failures lead to billions in lost opportunities.  
Also mild headaches.

---

# Slide 3 — The Truth We Will Pretend Is Objective
The average contractor:
- Stops following up after 1.3 attempts  
- Forgets to call back 62% of the time  
- Opens 19 unrelated browser tabs while “researching” a prospect  
- Says “I’ll get to it this afternoon” four times a day  

Meanwhile, their competitors respond faster.

This is the entire story of modern construction sales.

We support all of these activities.

# Slide 7 — Competitive Landscape
### Alternatives:
- Hiring an in-house SDR (good luck)

# Slide 8 — Why It Works (According to Science, Probably)
Studies suggest:
- Responding quickly increases deal odds by 50%  
- Persistence increases conversion by 280%  
- Appointment setting increases ROI by 3–10x  
- Contractors are happiest when someone else does the follow-up  

E BookGov aligns with all four findings.
